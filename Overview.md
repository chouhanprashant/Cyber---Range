---

## 1. How Will It Be Done? (Execution Approach)

1. **Requirement Gathering**
   - List all features and scenarios you want in the product.
   - Discuss with stakeholders and finalize the scope.

2. **Team Formation**
   - Hire or assign people for each required role (see below).

3. **Setup & Planning**
   - Register domain, set up cloud accounts (Azure/AWS), and create code repositories.
   - Prepare initial documentation and project plan.

4. **Development Phases**
   - **Phase 1:** Build core modules (user management, scenario management, lab automation).
   - **Phase 2:** Add advanced features (analytics, reporting, billing).
   - **Phase 3:** Testing, bug fixing, and user feedback.
   - **Phase 4:** Final deployment, launch, and support.

5. **Review & Iterate**
   - Regularly review progress, get feedback, and improve.

## 5. Structural Approach (Recommended Steps)

1. **Start Small:**  
   - Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with basic features.
   - Test with a small group of users.

2. **Iterate Fast:**  
   - Collect feedback and improve features in short cycles (sprints).

3. **Scale Gradually:**  
   - Add more scenarios, analytics, and automation as you grow.

4. **Keep Security First:**  
   - Regularly audit and test for vulnerabilities.

5. **Document Everything:**  
   - Maintain clear documentation for users and developers.
